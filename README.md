The aim is to develop a small application using router, views, models and collections. Read [Backbone documentation](http://backbonejs.org/) for details.

Here is the application we want to build :

Required
--------

Use node to start the server on port 5000 :

    node server/server.js


Exercises
---------

Follow the instructions at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).


To go further
-------------

* Use a template engine, like Mustache, to split templates from views ([documentation](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) and [download](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/blob/master/mustache.js) links).
* Use [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) or another AMD loader, to load your files and use them as modules by dependency references, instead of listing all files in order in index.html head.
